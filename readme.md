# The Interceptor Alpha
The Interceptor is a browser extension that explains what kind of Ethereum transactions you are making. Interceptor works with Metamask or without Metamask. If Metamask is installed, you can send transactions with The Interceptor by forwarding the transactions for Metamask for signing. But where The Interceptor really thrives, is Simulation Mode. the mode enables you to simulate multiple transactions and see what they do, you can even use DApps in simulation for free! We currently Support Chrome, Firefox and Brave. What comes to networks, we are supporting Ethereum Mainnet and GÃ¶rli.

# Privacy
We value your privacy highly. The Interceptor is designed to minimize privacy leakage: We don't query external sites for anything. However, The Interceptor Alpha is currently connecting to Ethereum RPC nodes operated by Green House. This is going to change in the future. Currently, users are not able to switch RPC nodes, as The Interceptor requires a non-standard Ethereum RPC feature to be able to simulate transactions.

# Installation
Download [The Interceptor](https://github.com/DarkFlorist/green-house/releases/latest) and depending on your browser:

- Chrome: Browse to `chrome://extensions/` and click `Load unpacked` and select the zip.
